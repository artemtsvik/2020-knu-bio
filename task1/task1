Base operations on Elliptic Curve on G1 and G2
- Please print result after each step 
- G1 - generator of elliptic curve group 1
- G2 - generator of elliptic curve group 2

1. Create jupyter file
2. Include bn256 module from lib directory
3. Generate three random numbers r1, r2, r3 in filed Fp1 with order 2^256
4. Calculate: T1 = r1 * G1
5. Calculate: T2 = r2 * G1
6. Calculate: T3 = r3 * G1
7. Calculate: TP = T1 + T2 - T3
8. Calculate: T4 = r1 * G2
9. Calculate: T5 = r2 * G3
10. Calculate: T6 = r3 * G4
11. Calculate: TQ = T4 + T5 - T6
12. Calculate: tf = r1 + r2 - r3
13. Calculate: E1 = pairing(G1, G2) ^ (tf*tf)
14. Calculate: E2 = pairing(TQ, TP)
